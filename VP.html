    <P> In 2008 Biden opted to run for President, but failed to gain traction against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.  Shortly after withdrawal from the race, Obama spoke with Biden about putting him into a high-ranking postion in the Obama administration.   </P>
	
	<P>In June 2008 Biden said he would take an offer for Vice President if given to him.  In August of 2008 Obama announced that Biden would be his ruining mate.
	
	<P>All throughout his time as VP the friendship between the POTUS and the VP has been seen, but toward the end of his term, Biden became a feature of many satrical internet jokes "Memes" </P>
	
	<P>The "bromance" culminated in President Obama awarding Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January 2017 </P>
